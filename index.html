        <p class="centered">It's finally the day! It's your birthday! WOOHOO! You're 22 and I'm definitely the more excited one out of the both of us. I'm pretty sure I've probably called and made you smile by now - I'm kinda cool that way; and you're on your way to kickstarting twenty two in style. I really really wish I could have been there today to celebrate your special day with you, but life isn't fair and I need to deal. And that is the story of how I decided to do this cute little thing for you. Hopefully, you can keep coming back and looking at it whenever you want to. Happy Birthday again Pish. You mean the world to me. <3 </p>

        <p>Hey cutie! First of all can I say 'Aweee You Miss Me? *Puppy Eyes*'? Coming back on track, I miss you too - VERY MUCH! Now I want you to think about the last time we met. As of today, the last time we met was your convo and that was great (inspite of that minor bit where I was a big baby and threw a major tantrum. OOPS?). Next, I want you to think about when you're going to see me next. At this moment, I think it's going to be at your 'delayed birthday celebration' as I like calling it and I'M SO EXCITED FOT IT! The point of this exerciseis to remeber the good times and think about when you're going to see me next because that's what helps me when I miss you and I miss you 16738377388 times a day. You're amazing sugarplum and I can't wait to see you. If you really a lot what are you waiting for? Pick up the damn phone and call me! *Chalie Puth's One Call Away in the background*</p>

Obviously I'm going to urge you to read through our most recent racy conversation. Those are always exciting. Remeber our escapades in Red Rock? SJA? Detective Pikachu? Pikachu will always have a special place in my heart after that. Anyway naughty boy, ask me for some NSFW content and you'll get plenty. Also, we never did make that google doc with all of our fantasies did we? Chop Chop! Let's get to it. I'm excited for each and every oneof them. *Slowly removes bra and throws it at you*</p>

        <p>Hey baby. First, you need some kisses. *kissesX4* Better! I don't know what it is that's upsetting you but I so know something. You are one amongst the most motivating and inspiring people I have ever met. whe you set your mind onto soething, I have seen you work slowly, but surely and tirelessly to achieve it. Whatever is happeneing now, I'm sure it's a minor setback; you'll fix it, because you're amazing that way. I don't believe in a lot of people's abilities (purely because most of them are slackers) but you, I believe in! Not everyone can pickup a random underconfident girl, mentor her and keep pushing her to get better and to succeed, but you've done it. You've proven people wrong in the past (placements, etc) and I have no doubt that you will do it again. Go out and conquer the world! Never forget that my complete faith and trust is vested in you.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>Once upon a time there was a sad, insecure girl in a relationship she didn't know how to get out of. She befriended a guy who seemed extremely nice and who she later came to realize, was strikingly similar to her! Together they got lunch and roamed around the Kingdom of Manyata Tech for six weeks, four days ofthe wek; and as each day passed they got to know each other better. However, as each day passed, the girl's relationship got worse and worse. She felt trapped and the only thing that made her smile was the boy. The boy took her for ice-cream and made her feel better when her world was collapsing. He made her feeling like a queen on her birthday. He helped her lern what she had to learn to get an internship. It was a blissfull few weeks, but then they had to come back to the hot kingdom of NITK. The boy thought that their friendship would evaporate like everything else did in the arid temperature - but the girl had other plans. Of course, she could not let that happen! (OUTRAGEOUS) And so, they hung out together. The boy continued to tutor the girl and without realizing it the girl fell in love. But she was deadly scared. What if he didn't love her back? Could she survive the loss of another important person in her life? Finally with the assistace of some liquid courage, she summoned the nerves to kiss him and he kisses back (after a shock period). It's been a blissfull one and half year since. Initailly, they were close together and they would go on long walks at night and kiss under the stars. But he had to move away to another kingdom. Sometimes it's very hard and the girl wishes he was by her side. But he's worth it. No one has ever made her happier.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I'd really want to write poetry here, but I'm a sucky poet. Remember the piece I wrote once? Shooting Star? You're my one in a million. There is not a long list of things I wouldn't do for you because you're that important to me. You smile makes me go weak in the knees. Your kisses fill me with joy and your arms are my happy place. You mean thw world to me and if I have to spend a long long time telling you this I will. The best part of it all is you're so similar to me I know when you're upset, sad, angry, frisky, happy, etc. We're on the same waveelngth and it's so easy for me to get along with you and love you the way I want to - extra and with all my heart. You make me smile. You make my world a happier place. I love you HKT. <3 </p>
